internet-uptime
=======================================

Small script to check if my internet provider is providing me with internet. 

## How to use
  1. Scheduled to run quite often (every minute, every 15 minutes or whatever). I use a Jenkins script for this.
  2. Parse the output in xxxx-xx-xx uptime.csv
